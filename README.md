# bwt-aqaperla
Project to read smart-meter data from BWT Aqa Perla S water softener. 
As they are equipped with a USB serial port I did some search on the web and
found some code artifacts from some home-automation projects:

However, none of the above can be used standalone. I am working on my "smarthome" 
project and as well was interested to gain access to the BWT smart meter using
a Raspberry PI and Python.
